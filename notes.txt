- Update blueprint so that yaw is controlled by the AzimuthGimbal, pitch controlled by the spring arm
- If you'd like to keep the roll locked to the landscape horizon when driving over uneven terrain, go to Details window of the Spring Arm and de-select "inherit roll" under the "Camera Settings" pane.
